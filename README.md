For the UMCG hospital and University of Groningen me and 4 other students developed a proof of concept for an indoor navigation app that would help students to find their way to lectures.

The video above showcases the full user experience of the app as it is intended with an additional Augmented Reality functionality to assist in wayfinding.

I developed the use of this Augmented Reality part of the project in Unity engine as well as conducting multiple interviews and playtests with a wide variety of users.

During the project we were rewarded with a prize from both the Hanzehogeschool college and Placenote, the developer of the Augemented Reality platform that we used.
